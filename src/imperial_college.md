# Period: Rise of the Imperial College (Light)

(15,MD) After the destruction caused by the war, the Congress of Cults decided to
create an Imperial College to run the cities and to teach magic. This resulted
in a unity among magic users because they were all connected to the school.  The
college was founded above an ancient library that only the highest ranking
wizards are given access to.
