> (6,WD) It is late; the air in the tenement room is chill. Mingus sits at a small
table, barely large enough for a page and a bottle of ink. "Severus," he writes,
shivering, "The pressure on unlicensed wizards is becoming intolerable. You know
as well as I do why we can't get licensesâ€”Congress of Cults, bah! We must band
together! Meet me...."

## Event: The Exhumation of Samuel Mingus (Dark)

(8,MD) Research and study done on the corpse of Mingus Magnus the Magus long after
his death indicated assassination through poison rather than death by food
poisoning as previously thought. The culprit remains unknown.
