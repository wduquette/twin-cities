# Start: Founding of the Kingdom of the Twin Cities (Light)

Founding of the Kingdom of the Twin Cities of Farland and Gognor.

## Event: Tom Mingus opens tailor's shop in Farland (Light)

(1,WD) Tom Mingus, ancestor of Mingus the Great (aka Mingus Magnus the Magus,
founder of the Farland Wizard's Guild), opens a tailor's shop in Farland and is
quite successful because all of his garments fit perfectly.

## Event: Septimus Slope Discovers Library (Light)

(4,TM) After being denied tenure for the third time, failed religious scholar
Septimus Slope wanders into the desert to die, only to stumble upon the remains
of a vast library buried in the sand and filled with esoteric tomes by a
forgotten sect of renegade monotheistic wizards.

## Event: Septimus Slope Receives Tenure (Light)

(13,DT) Septimus Slope is awarded a tenure position, and a large grant to excavate
his discoveries in the vast desert wastes south of Gognor.

### Scene: How was the Greater Partzufim found?

> (14,DT) Late afternoon Gognor Desert; the sun is slanting into the entry of a
white canvas tent as Septimus Slope is hunched over several loose sheets of aged
parchment spread on the wooden camping table before him. A journal lies open in
his lap. The last entry reads: "Have sufficiently deciphered the codex fragments
from grid 4 to know that they are a part of what was called the Lesser Partzium,
a book of common wisdom. It seems to constantly refer to a greater work of some
importance by 'Durma the Elder'..."

> "Professor Slope! Professor Slope!" calls a very red-faced out-of-breath young
man as he is seen running toward the tent entrance. The lad stops at the tent
door and hunches over, resting his hands on his knees as he manages to pant out,
"Penelopy says she has found what appears to be the Grand Hall. She was wrapping
up the quarter section in grid 21, when her foot broke right through the balk,
we almost lost her. We lowered a lantern, the room is huge with what appears to
be an iron cage surrounding a large codex in the center. Come see!"

### Scene: What was the first alarming report from the Dalchuzim Excavations? (Dark)

> (18,DT) Dusty rays of sunlight beam down from a hole in a high vaulted ceiling.
The top of a tall ladder vanishes upward through the bright opening, its feet
resting on well-worn tile flooring. The Grand Hall of Dalchuzim is cavernous and
still. Dim corners out of reach of the pool of bright light at the foot of the
ladder flicker with an odd assortment of lamps and candles. Boxes of tools and
equipment are scattered over the floor. In the center of the room sits a large
cage of iron. Several bars of the cage have been freshly sawn through to allow
passage. On an iron stand in the middle of the cage rests a large tome. Before
it stands a man in a white straw hat. The book, now open, but once bound with
ropes and wax seals, looks far older than even the room itself. The man, eyes
glazed and tears streaming down his face stares transfixed at its pages.
Suddenly. he snaps his head up and shouts "Durma Ebah Exta Theroon!".

> "You okay down there Prof?" calls Penelope Wendle. Leaning over and peering down
into a hole in the desert floor. After a brief but worrisome delay, she hears
from below, "What? ah, just fine, coming back up". As Penelope looks up, an old
woman stands before her. The woman nods at Penelope and then becomes like
wind-blown sand and vanishes. "I saw that too" whispers Michael from behind her.

### Scene: Why was the Greater Partzufim never copied? (Dark)

> (19,WD) In a locked scriptorium at the University of Gognor, Sebastopol Omnitz
places the Greater Partzufim on a reading stand. The room is large, with many
writing desks, but he is alone. Sweat runs down his brow; he curses and wipes it
with a rag. He positions a leaf of parchment on the writing desk, and sharpens
his quill. At last, he opens the massive tome to the first page...and begins to
read. The quill falls from his hand as he turns the page. Emotions cross his
face: wonder, horror, elation.

> He is found in the morning, a desiccated husk, one hand still resting on page
twenty-three. Some will read more; some will read less. And the few who read to
the last page and survive have other concerns.

## Event: Closing of the Library of Dalchuzim (Dark)

(17,WD) Alarmed by reports coming from the excavations at Dalchuzim in the desert,
High Wishop Telluriand of Gognor and Elder Primus Sandoval the Bastard, High
Priest of the Temple of Cheva, puts pressure on the King of Gognor to close down
the excavations. Septimus Slope hides a number of tomes, including the Lesser
Partzium, in the crypts under the University of Gognor, and flees to Farland
with his wife and child.
