<p>(1,WD) Tom Mingus, ancestor of Mingus the Great (aka Mingus Magnus the Magus,
founder of the Farland Wizard's Guild), opens a tailor's shop in Farland and is

<p>(4,TM) After being denied tenure for the third time, failed religious scholar
Septimus Slope wanders into the desert to die, only to stumble upon the remains
of a vast library buried in the sand and filled with esoteric tomes by a
forgotten sect of renegade monotheistic wizards.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#event-septimus-slope-receives-tenure-light" id="event-septimus-slope-receives-tenure-light">Event: Septimus Slope Receives Tenure (Light)</a></h2>
<p>(13,DT) Septimus Slope is awarded a tenure position, and a large grant to excavate
his discoveries in the vast desert wastes south of Gognor.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#scene-how-was-the-greater-partzufim-found" id="scene-how-was-the-greater-partzufim-found">Scene: How was the Greater Partzufim found?</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>(14,DT) Late afternoon Gognor Desert; the sun is slanting into the entry of a
white canvas tent as Septimus Slope is hunched over several loose sheets of aged
parchment spread on the wooden camping table before him. A journal lies open in
his lap. The last entry reads: &quot;Have sufficiently deciphered the codex fragments
from grid 4 to know that they are a part of what was called the Lesser Partzium,
a book of common wisdom. It seems to constantly refer to a greater work of some
importance by 'Durma the Elder'...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Professor Slope! Professor Slope!&quot; calls a very red-faced out-of-breath young
man as he is seen running toward the tent entrance. The lad stops at the tent
door and hunches over, resting his hands on his knees as he manages to pant out,
&quot;Penelopy says she has found what appears to be the Grand Hall. She was wrapping
up the quarter section in grid 21, when her foot broke right through the balk,
we almost lost her. We lowered a lantern, the room is huge with what appears to
be an iron cage surrounding a large codex in the center. Come see!&quot;</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#scene-what-was-the-first-alarming-report-from-the-dalchuzim-excavations-dark" id="scene-what-was-the-first-alarming-report-from-the-dalchuzim-excavations-dark">Scene: What was the first alarming report from the Dalchuzim Excavations? (Dark)</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>(18,DT) Dusty rays of sunlight beam down from a hole in a high vaulted ceiling.
The top of a tall ladder vanishes upward through the bright opening, its feet
resting on well-worn tile flooring. The Grand Hall of Dalchuzim is cavernous and
still. Dim corners out of reach of the pool of bright light at the foot of the
ladder flicker with an odd assortment of lamps and candles. Boxes of tools and
equipment are scattered over the floor. In the center of the room sits a large
cage of iron. Several bars of the cage have been freshly sawn through to allow
passage. On an iron stand in the middle of the cage rests a large tome. Before
it stands a man in a white straw hat. The book, now open, but once bound with
ropes and wax seals, looks far older than even the room itself. The man, eyes
glazed and tears streaming down his face stares transfixed at its pages.
Suddenly. he snaps his head up and shouts &quot;Durma Ebah Exta Theroon!&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You okay down there Prof?&quot; calls Penelope Wendle. Leaning over and peering down
into a hole in the desert floor. After a brief but worrisome delay, she hears
from below, &quot;What? ah, just fine, coming back up&quot;. As Penelope looks up, an old
woman stands before her. The woman nods at Penelope and then becomes like
wind-blown sand and vanishes. &quot;I saw that too&quot; whispers Michael from behind her.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(19,WD) In a locked scriptorium at the University of Gognor, Sebastopol Omnitz
places the Greater Partzufim on a reading stand. The room is large, with many
writing desks, but he is alone. Sweat runs down his brow; he curses and wipes it
with a rag. He positions a leaf of parchment on the writing desk, and sharpens
his quill. At last, he opens the massive tome to the first page...and begins to
read. The quill falls from his hand as he turns the page. Emotions cross his
face: wonder, horror, elation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He is found in the morning, a desiccated husk, one hand still resting on page
twenty-three. Some will read more; some will read less. And the few who read to
the last page and survive have other concerns.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#event-closing-of-the-library-of-dalchuzim-dark" id="event-closing-of-the-library-of-dalchuzim-dark">Event: Closing of the Library of Dalchuzim (Dark)</a></h2>

Partzium, in the crypts under the University of Gognor, and flees to Farland
with his wife and child.</p>

<p>(3,MD) The Wizards Fabien of Gognor and Gideon of Farland join their two factions

<p>(20,MD) The Congress was small when it first began, though its size grew with its importance. This meeting takes place in a private room at an inn that is halfway between the two cities.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#event-samuel-mingus-is-born-light" id="event-samuel-mingus-is-born-light">Event: Samuel Mingus is Born (Light)</a></h2>
<p>(7,DT) Samuel Mingus is born in a small shack on top of Mount Wendle, the first

Rising Sun.&quot;  Anatolia is his mother.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#event-slopes-document-cache-is-rediscovered-light" id="event-slopes-document-cache-is-rediscovered-light">Event: Slope's Document Cache is Rediscovered (Light)</a></h2>
<p>(9,TM) Severus Slope finds a cache of documents hidden by his ancestor Septimus
Slope alluding to an ancient magical and belief system which had been erased
from history and actively suppressed by the Congress. He believes its
suppression may have been the entire purpose of the Congress. He brings them to
his friend Samuel Mingus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(6,WD) It is late; the air in the tenement room is chill. Mingus sits at a small
table, barely large enough for a page and a bottle of ink. &quot;Severus,&quot; he writes,
shivering, &quot;The pressure on unlicensed wizards is becoming intolerable. You know
as well as I do why we can't get licenses—Congress of Cults, bah! We must band
together! Meet me....&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#event-the-exhumation-of-samuel-mingus-dark" id="event-the-exhumation-of-samuel-mingus-dark">Event: The Exhumation of Samuel Mingus (Dark)</a></h2>
<p>(8,MD) Research and study done on the corpse of Mingus Magnus the Magus long after
his death indicated assassination through poison rather than death by food
poisoning as previously thought. The culprit remains unknown.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#period-the-wizard-war-dark" id="period-the-wizard-war-dark">Period: The Wizard War (Dark)</a></h1>
<p>(10,WD) The realm of the Twin Cities falls into an extended period of warfare
during which the forces of the Congress of Cults attempts to root out and
destroy all members of the Unlicensed Wizard's Guild founded by Samuel Mingus
and Severus Slope. At the end of the period the survivors of the Guild are in
hiding, the economy of the realm has been devastated, large tracts of land are
uninhabitable, and the authority of the Congress is in tatters.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#event-slaughter-of-guild-members-in-gognor-dark" id="event-slaughter-of-guild-members-in-gognor-dark">Event: Slaughter of Guild Members in Gognor (Dark)</a></h2>
<p>(11,WD) Following the slaughter of the guild members in the city of Gognor, the
remaining leadership of the Unlicensed Wizard's Guild, assembled in secret in a
cellar in Farland, pledge to oppose the Congress of Cults and all its works and
all its empty promises, declaring as the Guild's patron their dimly remembered
founder Samuel Mingus, whom they now christen Mingus Magnus the Magus, Martyr to
the Congress of Cults. Word goes out to the Guild's cells in the cities and
towns of the realm: &quot;Never Again!&quot;</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#event-destruction-of-the-tome-dark" id="event-destruction-of-the-tome-dark">Event: Destruction of the Tome (Dark)</a></h2>
<p>(12,TM) One of the key documents is a book called the Greater Partzufim.
Discovered in the lost library, it contains knowledge both sides wish to control
for their own reasons. At the end of the Wizard War, in a bittersweet victory
for the Congress of Cults, they successfully destroy the tome and its contents
are lost.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(16,TM) Trench 777, a useless defensive position in an unimportant place, is
finally overrun by the forces of the Congress of Cults, becoming the last battle
of the the Wizard War. The High Wishop Verria Etpax arrives in caravan, and is
greeted by a diminutive subaltern. He is led through the smoking residue of
magical fire, past the melting remains of the dead and dying and into an
underground command center. Tunnels snake in all directions and the wounded line
the walls, but his attention is fixed on the nondescript box at the center of
the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He steps forward then checks himself. &quot;Take it to the middle of the battlefield, pile it with biridian sulfair, and flame it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Should we inspect it first?&quot; his aid asks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I dare not. I fought a war, tortured innocents, hunted friends to their deaths,
and did countless other terrible things to make sure what is in this tome is
never known to the world, and now all I feel is an overwhelming desire to lose
myself in its pages. It calls to me even as I say these words.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Flame it!&quot; the aide shouts. &quot;Let the fires of Nantox purify our realm!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Flame and purify!&quot; the men shout in response. &quot;Hail Nantox! Hail the
purifying flame!&quot;</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#period-rise-of-the-imperial-college-light" id="period-rise-of-the-imperial-college-light">Period: Rise of the Imperial College (Light)</a></h1>
<p>(15,MD) After the destruction caused by the war, the Congress of Cults decided to
create an Imperial College to run the cities and to teach magic. This resulted
in a unity among magic users because they were all connected to the school.  The
college was founded above an ancient library that only the highest ranking
wizards are given access to.</p>

<p>Utter collapse of civilization following the decay of the Imperial College of
Wizards. (&quot;Imperial College&quot; as in &quot;The College has Imperial power&quot;.)</p>
